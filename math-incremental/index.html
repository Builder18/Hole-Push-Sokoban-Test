	<p>
		Welcome to Math Incremental Version 1!
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This version introduces the basics: Add, multiply and percent add.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Prestige <abbr>TBD</abbr>, To Be Decided...
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The plan is to have 2 prestige layers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		First increases your base income and second increases your base multiplier, 
		making not only the start faster but also lets you reach further within a reasonable timeframe.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I guess first prestige would depend on your current income. 100k maybe is where you can do one of these?<br />
		<br />
		
		Second prestige would require having enough 1st prestiges 
		and would reset everything, including 1st prestige count and their income increase.
