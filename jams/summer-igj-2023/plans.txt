Progress bar with 100% of energy.

Matter counter.
Button to convert 1% of energy to X amount of matter. (Starts at 1)

Plans

You slowly regain energy after using it.
This can be improved with expensive generator upgrades.

Main upgrade you buy with matter is matter efficiency augmentator.

Augmentators increase your energy to matter efficiency with x2 each?



Could also allow automated energy conversion to matter.

Update:
A la Crank style conversion that 
doesn't need constant clicking, but you need to 
click again when it's done prosessing the matter?
